# MAUDE Database Searcher

This repository contains the files of a RAG pipeline that searches and summarizes the MAUDE database, based on a user query. It requires the database to be downloaded, organized, embedded, and vectorized using the FAISS library.

The updater files can be ran as scheduled tasks to regularly update existing datasets or create new datasets.
